# Red Academy html quiz
#### A HTML quiz for prospective Professional Web Development students in Toronto

In this quiz, I attempted to re-create the mock-up of red-landing.jpg to test my ability in HTML and CSS. In the red academy repo, I was given a starter HTML file called `index.html` with some starter HTML components and a CSS stylesheet labeled `stylesheet.css`.

## Requirements
The requirements of my project are outlined below:
* Adequately reflect the designerâ€™s vision for the website
* Contain a single `.html` file and an external `.css` file (a CSS reset may be included separately)
* [More on CSS Reset here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11578819/css-reset-what-exactly-does-it-do)

## Design Specifications 
I was given a list of specific instructions to follow when designing the website. The The mock up red-landing page uses the font-family Roboto, which is a google font. I followed instructions on how to install and use this google font from this [website](http://www.cssnewbie.com/how-to-use-google-fonts-with-css-tutorial/#.WXitnIjyuiM)

My design specifications are outlined below:
* The mock up red-landing page uses three different font weights : 100, 300 and 900
* Titles and headings use the color : #333333 
* The banner uses the color : #FFFFFF
* The content uses the color : #666666

#### Strech goals 
As an ambitious individual, I attempted these stretch goals outlined below to impress my colleagues. All can be found in my repo titled redlandingpage.

* Have a Git repository initialized in its root directory with an appropriately customized .gitignore file.
* Be pushed to GitHub (with all of your commits synced to it) containing a README.md file describing the project (e.g. technologies used, personal learnings, etc.).
* Have your site only using flex instead of floats or positioning.
