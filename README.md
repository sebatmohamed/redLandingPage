# Red Academy HTML quiz
#### A HTML quiz for prospective Professional Web Development students in Toronto

In this quiz, I attempted to re-create the mock-up of red-landing.jpg to test my ability in HTML and CSS. I was given a starter HTML file with some starter HTML components and a CSS stylesheet. I used the skeleteon outline I was provided in the starter HTML file to help me get on my feet. I built off of it based on what I learned from resources like freecodecamp, codecademy, google and others. 

In this repo, you will find my index.html file, .css file, reset.css file. You will also find a Git repository initialized in its root directory with an appropriately customized .gitignore file. 

## Requirements
The requirements of my project are outlined below:
* Adequately reflect the designerâ€™s vision for the website
* Contain a single `.html` file and an external `.css` file with a CSS reset file included separately

Using this [CSS Reset](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11578819/css-reset-what-exactly-does-it-do) resource, I was able understand the purpose of this and implement the code into my reset.css file and then adjust my own code accordingly.  

## Design Specifications 
I was given a list of specific instructions to follow when designing the website. The mock up red-landing page uses the font-family Roboto, which is a google font. I followed instructions on how to install and use this google font from this [website](http://www.cssnewbie.com/how-to-use-google-fonts-with-css-tutorial/#.WXitnIjyuiM)

My design specifications are outlined below:
* The mock up red-landing page uses three different font weights : 100, 300 and 900
* Titles and headings use the color : #333333 
* The banner uses the color : #FFFFFF
* The content uses the color : #666666

## Technologies Used
I used Sublime text to write my code and HTML and CSS to recreate the red-landing.jpg.

## Personal Learnings
Coming from a science background, logical/computational thinking and analyzing data are skills I have developed. However, learning to code is helping me build these skills in a new way. 

I gained a greater appreciation for websites, how they work and how they are created. I was able to solve several problems in a logical and creative way. For example, there were two ways that I could have written the code for the 'home about contact' section. Whether I wrote it as a text or unordered list, the common thing between the two was using the CSS property display: flex as I had to align it with the RED ACADEMY logo in the top left corner. Throughout this process, I had to learn how to think differently. It wasn't just about learning how to type lines of codes, but being able to see the larger picture and break it down in to smaller pieces in order to effectively solve the problem. I had to work backwards from a one page webiste to the code to recreate the designer's wishes. There were many times where my code would not work and I had to figure out why. Sometimes it was trivial as having an extra " where it shouldn't have been, or not including the proper CSS selector, or even not typing in the proper code. I love that process of experiementing and trial and error to come up with a solution that works. 

As an individual with no background in coding, I was not sure what the purpose was of an external .css file or reset.css file.  After googling and learning more about the purpose of these files, I realized what was required of me. My final code was linked to an external .css or reset.css file.
