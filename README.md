# Red Academy html quiz
#### A HTML quiz for prospective Professional Web Development students in Toronto

In this quiz, I attempted to re-create the mock-up of red-landing.jpg to test my ability in HTML and CSS. I was given a starter HTML file called with some starter HTML components and a CSS stylesheet. I used the skeleteon outline I was provided to help me pick off. I built off of it based on what I learned from resources like freecodecamp, codecademy, google and others. 

## Requirements
The requirements of my project are outlined below:
* Adequately reflect the designerâ€™s vision for the website
* Contain a single `.html` file and an external `.css` file (a CSS reset may be included separately)
* [More on CSS Reset here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11578819/css-reset-what-exactly-does-it-do)

## Design Specifications 
I was given a list of specific instructions to follow when designing the website. The The mock up red-landing page uses the font-family Roboto, which is a google font. I followed instructions on how to install and use this google font from this [website](http://www.cssnewbie.com/how-to-use-google-fonts-with-css-tutorial/#.WXitnIjyuiM)

My design specifications are outlined below:
* The mock up red-landing page uses three different font weights : 100, 300 and 900
* Titles and headings use the color : #333333 
* The banner uses the color : #FFFFFF
* The content uses the color : #666666

## Technologies Used
I used Sublime text to write my code. 

## Personal Learnings
I gained a greater appreciation for websites, how they work and how they are created. I was able to solve several problems in a logical and creative way. For example, there were two ways that I could have written the code for the 'home about contact' section. Whether I wrote it as a text or unordered list, the common thing between the two was using the CSS property display: flex as I had to align it with the RED ACADEMY logo in the top left corner.
