# Red Academy html quiz
#### A HTML quiz for prospective Professional Web Development students in Toronto

In this quiz you will be trying to re-create the mock-up of red-landing.jpg. This aim of this quiz is to test your ability in HTML, and CSS.

## Design Specifications 
#### Typography:
The entire site uses the font-family Roboto, which is a google font. You will find instructions on how to install and use a google font [here](http://www.cssnewbie.com/how-to-use-google-fonts-with-css-tutorial/#.WXitnIjyuiM)
* The site uses three different font weights : 100, 300 and 900
* Titles and headings use the color : #333333 
* The banner uses the color : #FFFFFF
* The content uses the color : #666666

## Requirements
#### Your project must:

* Contain a single `.html` file and an external `.css` file (a CSS reset may be included separately)
* [More on CSS Reset here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11578819/css-reset-what-exactly-does-it-do)
* Adequately reflect the designerâ€™s vision for the website

#### Strech goals 
If you want to really impress, try some of these:
* Have a Git repository initialized in its root directory with an appropriately customized .gitignore file.
* Be pushed to GitHub (with all of your commits synced to it) containing a README.md file describing the project (e.g. technologies used, personal learnings, etc.).
* Have your site only using flex instead of floats or positioning. 

## Assets 
In the repo you will find a starter HTML file called `index.html` with some starter HTML to make things a bit easier and a CSS stylesheet labeled `stylesheet.css`. These files have already been linked in the `index.html`. What you are trying to recreate is the file labeled `red-landing.jpg`.
